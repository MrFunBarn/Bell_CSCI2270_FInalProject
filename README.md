# Quantum Maths Run With Some Basic Graphs.

QuantumSpins.cpp lets you run very simple electron spin mesurement simulations
by utilizing simple weighted graphs.

## Compilation

For conveiance (mine and yours) I've made up a simple make file to handle
compiling all the files needed. You can just run  the command 

```bash
make
```

in the directory with all the files.
